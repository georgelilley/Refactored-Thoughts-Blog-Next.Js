            Hey, I‚Äôm George Lilley, a software developer with a background in music technology and a fascination for engineering challenges. This blog is my space to document what I‚Äôm learning, explore interesting technical problems, and reflect on the evolving world of software and technology.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>

            My journey into coding started with creative projects‚Äîbuilding interactive music systems, writing firmware for robotic instruments, and experimenting with real-time audio processing. As I got deeper into programming, I became interested in backend development, automation, and security. I enjoy working on systems that require problem-solving at a deeper level, whether that‚Äôs designing secure web applications, optimising performance, or experimenting with new technologies.
