# Refactored-Thoughts

This project is a Next.js and TailwindCSS React web application currently under development, designed to power my personal blog site. The goal is to explore Next.js features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) to build a fast, SEO-friendly blog. Eventually, this will serve as a flexible foundation for creating scalable, high-performance web applications.

## Features to Be Added:
-  Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for faster load times and better SEO.
-  Static Site Generation (SSG) to enhance performance.
-  Built with React for dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
-  A clean, extendable structure for future growth and customization.
